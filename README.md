# cbp-tabulated-data
This repository makes accessible CBP data from cbp.gov for data analysis work. Publishing data in pdf's is an obstruction of transparency, rendering more difficult and time-consuming any analysis project. Instead of publishing excerpts from their databases, CBP chooses to publish disparate and pdf-locked stats. This repository hopes to eliminate this barrier.

Additionally, I include aggregated data that I've prepared for data visualization, and uploaded it here for reproducibility.
